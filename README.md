# Malware Classification
## Introduction

This project is a [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/) workflow that makes use of Machine Learning (ML) to classify unknown Windows Portable Executable (PE) files.

## Setup

Before starting to classify malware, there are some setup needed. First, the model needs to be trained and for that it needs sample. There are three directories in the workspace:

* Data/Benign
* Data/Malicious
* Data/Unknown

These directories should contain known benign PE files, known malicious PE files, and unknown malicious PE files respectively.

After you have acquired the benign and malicious samples needed to train the model, you need to download the [pecoff4j](https://github.com/whitesource/pecoff4j-maven) Java library into the `Library` directory. The workspace is configured to use version `0.0.2.1`.

## Classify Samples

Just drop the PE files in the `Data/Unknown` directory and run the workflow.
